PETRI-seq Pipeline protocol is originally from Sydney Blattman, Tavazoie Lab, Columbia University, March 2020, 
"Prokaryotic single-cell RNA sequencing by in situ combinatorial indexing" (doi: 10.1038/s41564-020-0729-6).

Updated by Alyssa R. Hamm, May 2025. Changed formatting and parameters to scripts for our publication.


This 1_PETRIseq folder has the files and scripts needed to run the full PETRI-seq pipeline. 
We have included notes about how to build a functional Conda Environment (Conda_Environment.txt), and how to start the pipeline in terminal (Start_Here.txt).
