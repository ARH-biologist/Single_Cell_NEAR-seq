"Prokaryotic single-cell RNA sequencing by in situ combinatorial indexing" (doi: 10.1038/s41564-020-0729-6).

Updated by Alyssa R. Hamm, May 2025. Changed formatting and parameters for our publication.



When you run Illumina sequencing, you will get 8 total fastq files, 4 for forward lanes, and 4 for reverse. 
Our data has been uploaded to NCBI SRA repository as 1 file for forward and 1 for reverse. These are the inputs for the PETRI-seq Pipeline.
